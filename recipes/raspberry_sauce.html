    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy and simple raspberry sauce or raspberry coulis is made with just 3 ingredients - fresh or frozen raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice. It's the perfect topping for cheesecake, ice cream, cakes, and other desserts!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz raspberries - fresh or frozen; about 3â…“ cups</li>
            <li>4 to 6 tablespoons granulated sugar - adjust to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice - or more</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Add the raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice to a saucepan and bring to a boil while mashing the raspberries to break them down. Once it boils, turn off the heat and adjust with more sugar or lemon juice as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain:</strong> Strain the raspberry sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove the seeds. Press firmly to extract all of the pulp as that is what thickens the sauce. If desired, thin with a teaspoon of water at a time, keeping in mind the sauce thickens as it cools (the sauce in the photo was not thinned). See Note 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Add to cheesecake, cakes, ice cream, or other desserts. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

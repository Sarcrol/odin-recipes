    <p>Homemade Hot Chocolate: You sweet, creamy heavenly thing. </p>
    <p>If you were wondering how I would like to spend every December evening, it is curled up, with my hands wrapped around a warm mug of hot chocolate. Bonus points if that hot chocolate is topped with freshly whipped cream and a heavy sprinkle of chopped dark chocolate.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>4 cups milk (preferably whole or 2%)</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate bar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place milk, cocoa powder and sugar in a small saucepan.</li>
            <li>Heat over medium/medium-low heat, whisking frequently, until warm (but not boiling).</li>
